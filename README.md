Use the Extension:

Clone the project locally. Then, go to the Extensions Manager page of Chrome. Turn on developer mode in the top right corner. Press Load Unpacked, and select the extension folder.

Commands:
Ctrl+A = I don't know

Test Your Inference:

Set up your own inference with a REST API. Accept POST requests from "mydomain.com" and expect JSON in this format:
{'inputs': 'I am text, or an image source, or a video link.'}

Return any JSON response, and it will display on the extension.
